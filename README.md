# Employee-Tracker
UNC Chapel Hill Challenge 12

## Purpose:
To create an application that is a Company Employee Information Content Management System (CMS). This CMS tool uses Node.js for the backend along with Inquirer.js to enable user management of company employees, roles, and departments in a MySQL database through command prompts in the terminal. This application can be easily used via any local directory containing the required files and packages.
